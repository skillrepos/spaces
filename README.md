# Understanding and using GitHub Codespaces - lab setup

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the course labs.

These steps **must** be completed prior to starting the actual labs.

## Create your own repository for these labs

- Create your own copy of this repository by forking the [skillrepos/spaces](https://github.com/skillrepos/spaces) project as a template into your own GitHub area.
- You do this by clicking the `Fork` button in the upper right portion of the main project page and following the steps to create a copy in **your-github-userid/spaces** .

## Configure your codespace

1. In your forked repository, start a new codespace.

    - Click the `Code` button on your repository's landing page.
    - Click the `Codespaces` tab.
    - Click `Create codespaces on main` to create the codespace.
    - After the codespace has initialized there will be a terminal present.

## Labs

2. After the codespace has started, open the labs document by going to the file tree on the left, find the file named **codespace-labs.md**, right-click on it, and open it with the **Preview** option.)

This will open it up in a tab above your terminal. Then you can follow along with the steps in the labs. 
Any command in the gray boxes is either code intended to be run in the console or code to be updated in a file.
